sbw_woq_h/readme.txt

The files in this directory were derived from my efforts to look at Week-Of-Month returns using hourly data.

I wrote a long readme for Week-Of-Month returns using hourly data which might be good background information 
for the scripts in this directory:

https://github.com/bikle/rluck/blob/master/sbw_wom_h/readme.txt

After I finished with that I focused on this question:

For a given pair, eur_usd for example, which is the best Week Of Quarter to buy or short that pair for a week?

I answered the question using the SQL script in this directory.

And the answer is Week Of Quarter #11.

More pairs and more Week Of Quarters are listed here:
