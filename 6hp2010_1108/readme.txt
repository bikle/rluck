6hp2010_1108/readme.txt

The scripts in this directory are an effort to find a consistent 6 hour period during every week after 2009-01-01 which was lucrative.

I identify each 6 hour period during each week with two numbers concatenated together into a string.

For example the string 1_23 would identify a 6 hour period which starts on Sunday at 23:00 and ends 6 hours after that.

With these scripts I found a series of lucrative trades starting on the 4th day of the week which is Wednesday.

On Wednesday the series starts at 19:00 and ends on Thursday at 01:00.

I keep a copy of the query output here:

All of the trades in the above report look attractive.

My favorite is this 6-hour-period-trade:

  - 3_12 (Tues, 12:00 GMT, Which is 4am in California)
  - Buy GBP, Sell USD (go-long on gbp_usd)
  - Hold for 6 hours and then close the position

The average normalized-period-gain has been 12 pips which is 2 pips / hour.

The opportunity has appeared 95 times since 2009-01-01.

This trade has so far accumulated 1117 pips which dwarfs the 250 pips I would need to finance the trade.

The most money lost on 1 execution of the trade has been -117 pips.

The most money gained on 1 execution of the trade has been  232 pips.

Normally, gains are within 52 pips of the 12 pip average.

Another aspect of the trade I like is that it is "sentiment-neutral".

Currently I am bearish on both USD and GBP.

I feel comfortable trading one for the other.
