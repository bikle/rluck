It appears that positive correlation between far-past and near-past is best for these days:

1, 4

which are Sunday and Wednesday.


Negative correlation dominates these days:

2,3 (Monday and Tuesday).

For any trader inclined to follow a positive correlation trend, it looks like Wednesday offers the most lucrative opportunities.

Inspection of the report below suggests to me that in the Far-Past we had a significant flow of value out of USD into GBP.

In the Near-Past, that flow has dramatically changed direction.

That reversed-flow seems most pronounced on Tuesdays during London trading hours.

So, that would be the best time of week for any trader inclined to follow a negative correlation trend.
