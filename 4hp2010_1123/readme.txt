4hp2010_1123/readme.txt

The scripts in this directory are an effort to find a consistent 4 hour period during every week after 2009-01-01 which was lucrative.

I identify each 4 hour period during each week with two numbers concatenated together into a string.

For example the string 1_23 would identify a 4 hour period which starts on Sunday at 23:00 and ends 4 hours after that.

I keep a copies of the query output at the URLs listed below:
