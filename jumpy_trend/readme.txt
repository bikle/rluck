/pt/s/rlk/jumpy_trend/readme.txt

I use the files in this directory to look for trends in Forex data.

The duration between data points for each pair is 10 minutes.

The trend I am looking for is not a price trend, it is a behavior trend.

I want to know if during times when price-moving-average-slope is beyond 2 standard deviations of its average,
is the currency pair "jumpy" in a predictable way.
