The scripts in this directory are an effort to find a consistent 8 hour period during every week after 2009-01-01 which was lucrative.

I identify each 8 hour period during each week with two numbers concatenated together into a string.

For example the string 1_23 would identify a 8 hour period which starts on Sunday at 23:00 and ends 8 hours after that.

With these scripts I found a series of lucrative trades starting on the 5th day of the week which is Thursday.

On Thursday the series starts at 04:00 GMT and lasts until 06:00 GMT.

For these 3 time-series-points (04:00, 05:00, 06:00) the pair to trade is a long position of AUD/USD.

This trade is bullish on AUD and bearish on USD which fits my current sentiment nicely.

I keep a copy of the query output here:

All of the trades in the above report look attractive.

My favorite is this 8-hour-period-trade:

  - 5_06 (Thurs, 06:00 GMT, Which is Wed-10pm in California)
  - Buy AUD, Sell USD (go-long on AUD/USD)
  - Hold for 8 hours and then close the position

The average normalized-period-gain has been 12 pips which is 1.5 pips / hour.

The opportunity has appeared 101 times between 2009-01-01 and 2010-12-10.

This trade has so far accumulated 1186 pips which dwarfs the 250 pips I would need to finance the trade.

The most money lost on 1 execution of the trade has been -110 pips.

The most money gained on 1 execution of the trade has been 181 pips.

Normally, gains are within 50 pips of the 12 pip average gain.
