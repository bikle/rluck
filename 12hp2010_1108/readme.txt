12hp2010_1108/readme.txt

The scripts in this directory are an effort to find a consistent 12 hour period during the week after 2009-01-01 which was lucrative.

I identify each 12 hour period during the week with two numbers concatenated together into a string.

For example the string 1_23 would identify a 12 hour period which starts on Sunday at 23:00 and ends 12 hours after that.

With these scripts I found a series of lucrative trades starting on the 4th day of the week which is Wednesday.

On Wednesday the series starts at 19:00 and ends on Thursday at 01:00.

I keep a copy of the query output here:
