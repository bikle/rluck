12hp2010_1108/readme.txt

The scripts in this directory are an effort to find a consistent 12 hour period during every week after 2009-01-01 which was lucrative.

I identify each 12 hour period during each week with two numbers concatenated together into a string.

For example the string 1_23 would identify a 12 hour period which starts on Sunday at 23:00 and ends 12 hours after that.

With these scripts I found a series of lucrative trades starting on the 4th day of the week which is Wednesday.

On Wednesday the series starts at 19:00 and ends on Thursday at 01:00.

I keep a copy of the query output here:

All of the trades in the above report look attractive.

My favorite is this 12-hour-period-trade:

  - 4_23 (Wednesday, 23:00 GMT, Which is mid-afternoon in California)
  - Buy AUD, Sell USD (go long on aud_usd)
  - Hold for 12 hours and then close the position

The average normalized-period-gain has been 17 pips which is more than 1 pip / hour.

The opportunity has appeared 96 times since 2009-01-01.

This trade has so far accumulated 1660 pips which dwarfs the 250 pips I would need to finance the trade.

The most money lost on 1 execution of the trade has been -223 pips.

The most money gained on 1 execution of the trade has been  199 pips.

Normally, gains are within 82 pips of the 17 pip average.

Another aspect of the trade I like is that it matches my sentiment.

Currently I am bullish on AUD and bearish on USD.
